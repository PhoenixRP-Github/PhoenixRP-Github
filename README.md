- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PhoenixRP
- ðŸ“« How to reach me | discord.gg/phoenixrp

Working hard on bringing a unique experience to the world of RP within FiveM. At PhoenixRP you will find activities that you have never experienced on any other server, everything we make is custom as we do not regurgitate FiveM store assets like all other ESX and QB servers as of late.

The server is moulded around the community and their ideas and we do not claim to be a large community in anyway way.

We have a solid community and people always find themselves back playing at PhoenixRP.

So, if you are looking for a place to hang out, meet new people and explore content that you have never experienced before then what are you waiting for?

PS: If you are reading this then you are probably having a nosey looking at how we are doing....we are doing great :D
